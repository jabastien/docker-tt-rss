## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`. 

As an example:

```
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

&nbsp;
## Application Setup

You must create a user and database for tt-rss to use in a mysql/mariadb or postgresql server. A basic nginx configuration file can be found in /config/nginx/site-confs , edit the file to enable ssl (port 443 by default), set servername etc.. Self-signed keys are generated the first time you run the container and can be found in /config/keys , if needed, you can replace them with your own.

**The default username and password after initial configuration is admin/password**

## Power users
The container can configure itself using environment variables, the gaurd for this logic to run is if the variable `DB_TYPE` is set. The most common variables to set are a URL for the application and a database endpoint. IE:
* -e DB_TYPE=mysql
* -e DB_HOST=host
* -e DB_USER=user
* -e DB_NAME=name
* -e DB_PASS=password
* -e DB_PORT=3306
* -e SELF_URL_PATH=http://localhost/

Please note if you use this method you need to have an already initialized database endpoint.
